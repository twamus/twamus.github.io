I have always had a fascination with technology. I can remember checking out books from the library in 3rd grade regarding BASIC programming that I would take home and excitedly pluck programs into my IBM PCjr, then proceed to tinker with and improve (or rather, break) things.

That was over 20 years ago. Since then, I have worked the last 10 years in IT. I've done everything from system administrator, data cleanup / data scrubbing, setting up variable print mailing pieces, to software development.

That said, I am always interested in learning and discovering new things.
