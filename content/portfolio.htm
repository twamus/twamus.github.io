<div>I'm still working on actually getting some projects that aren't intellectual property. All of these are free to use to your hearts content.</div>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.twam.us/nonogram/">Twamgram</a> - A nonogram/picross clone with a randomly generated board. Work in progress, but it functions at least as a 10x10 board.</li>
	<li><a href="scripts/PHP-lego.php">PHP Lego</a> - Script I used in attempting to make pixel art with Legos, with cost value if you were to buy each Lego online. Also, easy way to realize how cost prohibitive that can be! Can also be used for Perler / Hama beads too, I guess.</li>
	<li onclick="displayToggle(this);"><span class='context-hover'>+ <b>Python Scripts</b> (click to expand)</span>
	<ul style="display:none;" class='roller'>
		<li><a href="scripts/psycopg-pyexcelerate.py.txt">Psycopg2 and Pyexcelerate</a> - unused script for shipment reports. The PHP alternative worked better, so I went with that instead. However, that one's proprietary!</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

Well, hmm. I don't know, other than that, it's looking a little Baron Corbin* right now.<br><br>
<img src="img/corbin.jpg" width='200'>

<div><i>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin">Baron (now, King) Corbin</a> is a wrestler for WWE, and his name and likeness are (most likely) their intellectual property.</i></div>
