									<h2>qDIR64</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									The original qDIR was the name of an in-house file/data management tool written in qBASIC, used to process and manage mailing data lists.
									These utilities were written in Visual Basic and Python in around 2014.
								</p>
								<p>
									As 16-bit applications were reaching their end of life, a lot of our old data management tools were going to be left in the dust.
									We needed a solution to solve the looming deprecation of older software solutions, retain compatibility with older files, and allow
									for the future growth and additions to tools without breaking the core system or drastic changes to the workflow.
								</p>

								<br><br><br>
									<b>Noteable Features</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Fully controllable by keyboard navigation to speed up processing (selecting items with spacebar, tab to change to tools, using back arrow to swap between files and folders).</li>
										<li>Customizable toolbar; could enable and disable tools with dragg and drop.</li>
										<li>Purely modular; The core code was written in Visual Basic, but also supported tools written and scripts in Python and other languages.</li>
									</ul>
										<b>Python Tool Descriptions</b>
									<ul>
										<li><b>ADD (Python)</b>: Blindly combines multiple CSV files together. Useful for combining standardized lists.</li>
										<li><b>DBF to CSV (Python)</b>: Converts DBIII file to CSV format</li>
										<li><b>ODOA Test (Python)</b>: Strips line breaks out of the middle of CSV fields.</li>
										<li><b>Satori Prep (Python)</b>: Prepares a CSV to be ran through an automated template in Satori Bulk Mailer. The script would run, prompt the user to run Satori address verification, Satori would export a file, and the script would attach the fields we did not want modified by Satori</li>
										<li><b>Shuffle (Python)</b>: Used to prepare items for N-up printing. This would make it so that when printing and cutting a stack of postcards that they would be in the correct order.</li>
										<li><b>Split (Python)</b>: This would split one CSV file into multiple CSV files by a field value.</li>
										<li><b>Title Case (Python)</b>: Simply title cases all fields.</li>
										<li><b>Uppercase (Python)</b>: Simply makes every field uppercase.</li>
									</ul>
										<b>VB Tool Descriptions</b>
									<ul>
										<li><b>DBQ (VB)</b>: Simple and quick CSV viewer and editor (useful for when Excel really liked dropped leading "0"s on zip codes)</li>
										<li><b>LLoDD (VB)</b>: This would generate a suggested layout preview and breakdown/example of each fields to show the client and ask them what they would like on their mailing piece. This also generated .ADM files for use in inkjet address printers.</li>
										<li><b>Merge (VB)</b>: Merges numerous CSVs of varying contents together into one clean master. The user decides which fields get merged together into the output file</li>
										<li><b>Zip4 Finder (VB)</b>: Satori address checking would sometimes miss the mark on address checking. This tool would pull from the USPS website to verify the Zip+4, and then export it to an address record in Satori Bulk Mailer.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Project Management Tool</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Due to the nature of proprietary information on this project, I am unable to share any screenshots or the name of it, thus I will be referring to it as Project Management Tool, or PMT for short.
									I do, however, have license to create a mock-up, from memory, in Microsoft Paint!
								</p>
								<img src="projects/pmt-mockup.png">
								<br><br><br>
								<p>Initially, the workflow was based off of Excel documents that would get updated throughout the day/week, which was a logistical nightmare to ensure everyone was working off of the same document.
									This tool was created as a place to centrally host work orders relating to clients that would ship to multiple stores nation wide. Many of the orders would have similar base components, so there
									were templates and presets setup to help streamline the process.</p>
								<p>The end scope of this project was to house all of the data for each of the projects so that things such as packing and shipping could be automated.</p>
